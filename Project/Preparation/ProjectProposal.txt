For my semester project, I will investigate links and correlations between demographics and scores on Advanced Placement (AP) exams for high schools in New York City.  If possible, I will also attempt to identify the enrollment in AP classes by high school, and links with demographics.  The data will come from annual reports from the NYC Department of Education, as hosted on NYC OpenData.  I will attempt to see if there is a statistically significant relationship between AP test score and various demographic aspects (age, race, etc.), and to visualize this relationship.
