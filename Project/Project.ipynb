    "## Conclusions\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the correlation and linear relationships between Advanced Placement exam enrollment and performance against gender and racial demographics of high schools in New York City revealed the following:\n",
    "- There are weak correlations between gender composition of student populations and AP exam enrollment and performance\n",
    "  - The strongest of these correlations is 0.072 (with AP exam pass rate)\n",
    "  - The weakest of these correlations is 0.027 (with AP course enrollment)\n",
    "- There are stonger correlations between racial composition of student populations and AP exam enrollment and performance\n",
    "  - The strongest of these is 0.485 (between percent Asian and AP exam pass rate)\n",
    "  - The weakest of these is 0.165 (between percent Hispanic and AP exam pass rate)\n",
    "- There exist statistically significant relationships between racial composition of student populations and AP exam enrollment and performance\n",
    "  - The most significant of these is the relationship between percent Asian and AP course enrollment\n",
    "    - This relationship has a p-value of $1.77 \\times 10^{-28}$\n",
    "    - The equation describing this relationship is $$\\widehat{APEnrollment} = 0.072 + 0.301 * Asian$$\n",
    "  - The predictive power of these relationships is very low -- the highest $R^2$ value identified is 0.235, meaning that only 23.5% of variation in the identified dependent variable can be explained by variation in the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Areas for Investigation\n",
    "The high statistical significance of the linear regressions completed compared to their low predictive power suggests that the relationship between racial demographics may not be best described in a linear fashion.  Because there is, by definition, interaction between the four racial demographics investigated -- an increase in one variable necessitates a decrease in another -- a more complex linear regression may better explain the relationships between these demographic characteristics and AP-exam-related metrics.  Investigating the scatterplots of the variables, it seems possible that there is a non-linear relationship between racial demographics and AP exam enrollment and performance.  Higher-order regression may produce models with higher predictive power."
